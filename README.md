# Weather-Detection-
This project is built with the following features:

A clean, modern, and responsive design.

A "glassmorphism" aesthetic with transparent, blurred panels.

3D card-like effects on hover.

Dynamic background animations that reflect the current weather.

A dark mode by default, with a toggle for a light theme.

Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

Error handling for invalid city names.

To use this code, you will need to get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. After signing up, you can find your key on your account page. Just replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" in the script.js file with your actual key.
